/**
 * Structural pin for demo mode's network isolation (WP APP-DEMO review
 * round 2, blocker B1; narrowed further in round 3, F1). **Replaces the
 * earlier denylist-based `DemoModeNetworkIsolationTest` outright** -- that
 * test pinned seven SPELLINGS ("VaultApiClient", "okhttp3", ...), not
 * isolation itself. The reviewer demonstrated the gap directly: patching
 * [DemoClientsRepository.list] to call
 * `SteamOpenIdClient().checkAuthentication(...)` -- a live OkHttp POST to
 * `https://steamcommunity.com/openid/login`, fired every time the demo
 * clients sheet opens -- left the denylist scan AND the full 606-test suite
 * green, because `net.steam.*` (and every other symbol not on that
 * seven-item list) was simply never checked.
 *
 * The fix inverts the check to an ALLOWLIST: every qualified name `demo/`
 * and `ui/demo/` reference at all -- an `import` line or an inline
 * fully-qualified reference alike -- must fall inside [ALLOWED_PREFIXES],
 * for every name that starts with one of [WATCHED_PREFIXES].
 *
 * **What this actually checks, stated at the strength it actually has (F1
 * fix -- round 2's "fails closed BY CONSTRUCTION... including a class this
 * file's author has never heard of" overstated it, and the reviewer proved
 * the overstatement: `javax.net.SocketFactory` opened a real outbound TCP
 * socket and wrote a byte to it from `DemoClientsRepository.list()`, and
 * this test -- round 2's version, watching only `dev.steamvault.`/`java.`/
 * `okhttp`/`okio`/`coil` -- passed clean, 612/612, because `javax.` was
 * simply never on the list).** This is a FIXED, ENUMERATED denylist of
 * PREFIX FAMILIES ([WATCHED_PREFIXES]) crossed with an allowlist within
 * each -- not an unconditional guarantee. A qualified name rooted in a
 * family not in [WATCHED_PREFIXES] (this round added `javax.` and
 * `android.` after the reviewer's `javax.net.SocketFactory` mutation;
 * nothing else guarantees the NEXT unlisted family does not exist) is
 * invisible to it by the same mechanism that let `javax.` through before
 * this fix. What the test DOES guarantee, and what the reviewer verified
 * by attempting to construct every network-capable class actually reachable
 * from `repo/`: every constructible type in the repository interfaces this
 * package implements takes a `CredentialStore` or `VaultApiClient`
 * argument whose type name is off-allowlist, so reaching one requires a
 * qualified name this scan already catches -- and wildcard imports, type
 * aliases, inline fully-qualified names, and string-literal reflection are
 * all caught too, since the regex matches ANY dotted identifier chain in
 * the code, not just import lines. Call this a strong practical barrier
 * against the concrete network/platform-resource classes this codebase
 * and its dependencies expose today, not a proof against every possible
 * one.
 *
 * **A second, structural -- and UNFIXABLE by this technique -- gap (round
 * 4, Fix 2), distinct from an unlisted prefix family.** [QUALIFIED_NAME]
 * requires at least two dotted segments, so it only ever sees a
 * FULLY-QUALIFIED reference. Kotlin's implicit imports (`kotlin.*`,
 * `kotlin.collections.*`, and on the JVM target, `java.lang.*`) make a
 * whole class of JVM capability reachable with NO dotted name at all: the
 * reviewer measured `ProcessBuilder("/system/bin/ping", ...).start()` and
 * `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(...)` both building and running clean, 611
 * tests, zero failures, added to `DemoClientsRepository.list()` --
 * arbitrary process execution, a capability escape from the very sandbox
 * this test asserts. `ProcessBuilder(` is a bare, unqualified constructor
 * call (no segment to match at all); `Runtime.getRuntime` is rooted at
 * `Runtime`, a single identifier, not at `java.` -- neither is a
 * "qualified name" in the sense this scan understands, for the same
 * reason `println(...)` or `listOf(...)` are not. No amount of ADDING
 * prefixes to [WATCHED_PREFIXES] closes this: it is not a missing entry,
 * it is the technique's structural ceiling, because a fully-qualified-name
 * scan cannot see a name that was never qualified. The correct response is
 * NOT an identifier denylist (`"ProcessBuilder"`, `"Runtime"`, ...) added
 * here -- that would be a new instance of the exact defect class this
 * file's own history already ran through twice (round 2's seven-spelling
 * denylist, round 3's five-prefix-family denylist): a specific, enumerable
 * list standing in for an unconditional-sounding claim, one string short
 * of the next bypass. Recorded as an accepted structural gap instead.
 *
 * `stripComments` matches [DemoModeNetworkIsolationTest]'s original
 * reasoning: KDoc prose is allowed (and, in this package, expected) to NAME
 * a forbidden class when explaining why production code never references
 * it -- see e.g. `DemoRepositories.kt`'s own module kdoc, which says
 * "[dev.steamvault.app.net.VaultApiClient]" in exactly that sense.
