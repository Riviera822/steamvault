/**
 * WP AG-3 round 2 fix, blocker B2. The package's headline copy rule --
 * `installed_on` empty means "no fresh signal," which covers BOTH "never
 * installed anywhere" AND "installed, but the agent went quiet"
 * indistinguishably (api/README.md "Installed state per app") -- was
 * enforced by prose alone through round 1: three kdoc statements saying
 * `[]` must never render as "not installed anywhere," and nothing
 * mechanical stopping `installedBadgeText`'s `NoSignal` branch from doing
 * exactly that. The reviewer measured it: swapping `InstalledBadge.NoSignal
 * -> null` for `InstalledBadge.NoSignal -> "Not installed anywhere"` built
 * green at 643/643 with clean lint. This file is two independent pins:
 *
 *  1. A literal source check that the `NoSignal` branch of
 *     `installedBadgeText`'s `when` maps to `null` -- not a behavioral
 *     Compose call (this project has no Compose test rule / emulator to
 *     invoke a `@Composable` function from a plain JVM test, `app/README.md`'s
 *     standing constraint), but the same source-text-scan technique
 *     `DemoModeUiWiringTest`/`DemoModeImportAllowlistTest` already use for
 *     exactly this reason.
 *  2. A comment-stripped scan of every badge-path source file AND every
 *     `strings.xml` entry the badge path can render, asserting the
 *     forbidden phrase never appears in production text. Comments are
 *     stripped first because THIS kdoc, `InstalledBadgeText.kt`'s own
 *     kdoc, and `InstalledState.kt`'s kdoc all legitimately NAME the
 *     forbidden phrase while explaining why production code must never
 *     say it -- the same "prose may name it, code may not" exception
 *     `DemoModeImportAllowlistTest`'s `stripComments` already documents.
