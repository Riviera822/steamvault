/**
 * The curated seed data for a fresh demo session (WP APP-DEMO brief:
 * "invented fixtures, clearly labelled, exercising every screen and
 * state"). Every appid/name/client id below is fictional -- modeled on
 * `web/js/demo-data.js`'s tone and shape (per the WP brief's own pointer),
 * not copied from it, so this app's demo library reads as its own fixture
 * rather than a re-skin. None of it is real Steam data
 * (docs/LEARNINGS.md "Testing discipline": fixtures are synthetic, modeled
 * on real structure, never personal data).
 *
 * Six games chosen to exercise the same handful of states a screenshot or
 * a first look needs:
 *  - Duskfall Array: a plain `done` game, fully confirmed current.
 *  - Cobalt Isthmus: `idle` + `needs_force` with a SURVIVING
 *    `last_manifest_check` -- the post-cache-deletion shape
 *    (api/README.md), exercising `ui/detail/logic/DetailWording.kt`'s
 *    "confirmed before the cache was cleared" branch.
 *  - Wrenfield Static: `running` -- backed by the one seed job that starts
 *    already in flight, so the Downloads screen has something live to show
 *    immediately.
 *  - Halcyon Ledger / Pale Meridian: a genuine SHARED depot between two
 *    `done` games -- deleting either alone must skip that one depot (the
 *    other is still cached), exercising `ui/library/logic/MultiPlan.kt`'s
 *    sharing arithmetic end to end.
 *  - Marrowlight: `error` + `needs_force`, with a non-zero GC dry-run
 *    result (`gcReclaimableBytes`/`gcHeldBackBytes`) so the detail sheet's
 *    GC flow has something to find on the very first check.
