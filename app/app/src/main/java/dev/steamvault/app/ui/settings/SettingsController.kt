/**
 * Everything the Settings screen needs (WP 4b.7 brief) -- same thin-glue
 * shape every other screen controller in this app documents. Three
 * independent surfaces, each backed by its own real source, same split
 * `web/js/views/settings.js` documents:
 *
 *  - Vault / Schedule / Webhook -- one form over `GET`/`PATCH /v1/settings`
 *    (ADR-0009). The PATCH body is built by
 *    `ui/settings/logic/SettingsDiff.kt` from [drafts], populated ONLY by
 *    fields the user actually edits (via [setDraft]/[resetDraft]) -- never
 *    pre-seeded with every field's current value on [load] -- which is what
 *    makes "the body contains only changed keys" true by construction.
 *  - Steam identity -- the existing sign-in/out state
 *    ([dev.steamvault.app.repo.SteamIdentityRepository], unchanged from WP
 *    4b.3) plus, as of WP 4h.4, an on-demand library CHECK
 *    ([checkSteamLibrary]) against vault-api's relay -- there is no key to
 *    manage anymore (ADR-0004's second addendum), so this replaces the
 *    former Web API key entry/masked-display/remove UI this class used to
 *    own.
 *  - Connection -- [connectionSummary] reads [CredentialStore] directly
 *    (never the API key); [disconnect] clears the WHOLE store
 *    ("forget this vault" -- [CredentialStore.clear]'s own documented
 *    contract, deliberately broader than [CredentialStore.clearSteamIdentity]),
 *    and relies on the caller ([dev.steamvault.app.MainActivity]) to notice
 *    the connection is gone and swap back to the onboarding gate -- this
 *    controller has no reference to (and does not need one) whatever
 *    polling loop was running on another screen: this app's screens are
 *    plain state-switched (`ui/nav/Destination.kt`), so a screen not
 *    currently composed has no `LaunchedEffect` alive to stop in the first
 *    place, and a stale [dev.steamvault.app.net.VaultApiClient] can no
 *    longer be reached (nothing keeps `MainActivity`'s client
 *    reference around once it rebuilds from the now-cleared store).
 *
 * [settingsRepository] is a [SettingsRepository] rather than a raw
 * `VaultApiClient` (WP APP-DEMO refactor) -- the same seam every other
 * screen controller already has, so demo mode can hand this class an
 * in-memory [dev.steamvault.app.demo.DemoSettingsRepository] instead of
 * ever needing this class to know demo mode exists.
 *
 * [scheduleRepository] (WP AG-3, the seventh such seam) backs the
 * `GET /v1/schedule` read [schedule] exposes -- fetched best-effort inside
 * [load] alongside [settingsResponse]: a `/v1/schedule` failure must not
 * block the rest of the settings form from rendering, same posture the web
 * port's `load()` takes (`api.schedule().catch(() => null)`,
 * `web/js/views/settings.js`). [schedule] feeds
 * `ui/settings/logic/SchedulePresentation.kt`'s two pure functions, never
 * anything computed a second time from [settingsResponse]'s own
 * `sweep_include_cached`/`auto_gc` values.
